## Docker

Docker is an open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage containersâ€”standardized, executable components that combine application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

### System Requirements

Docker does not have any special requirement, it runs on all modern operating systems like Linux, Windows & MacOS.


## Installing Docker

Install Docker using apt package manager

    sudo apt install docker.io

![docker install apt](/steps/1.jpeg)

Install Docker using snap then checking version and status

    sudo snap install docker
    docker --version
    sudo systemctl status docker

![docker install apt](/steps/2.jpeg)


## Creating Docker Container

First lets check all the available Docker images then check all the running Docker containers

    sudo docker images
    sudo docker ps -a

![docker install apt](/steps/3.jpeg)

### Creating Node application

first run the following command:

    npm init -y

create file named **app.js** and add the following code:

    console.log("Hello from Node");

![docker install apt](/steps/4.jpeg)

then create a file named **Dockerfile** and add the following code:

    FROM node:16
    WORKINGDIR /app
    COPY ./ /app
    CMD ["node", "app.js"]
