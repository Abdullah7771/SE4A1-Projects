## Docker

Docker is an open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage containersâ€”standardized, executable components that combine application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

### System Requirements

Docker does not have any special requirement, it runs on all modern operating systems like Linux, Windows & MacOS.
